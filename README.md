## Overview

Sonex is a platform that allows audio professionals to work with their clients with ease. The platform allows for project creation and management, allows for clients to send files, and locks the finished files behind a paywall. This means that the freelancer gets paid in full for the agreed work, and the client can receive the files and project in full once paid for.

Clients do not need to sign up. With a verified email, a client can upload files needed to complete the project. Clients can listen to final versions uploaded without loss of quality. Clients can make time-stamped comments to either request changes or provide feedback. If changes needed, this will be communicated to the freelancer in the form of a `todo-list`.
